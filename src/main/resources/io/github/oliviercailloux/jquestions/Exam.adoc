== Q
Consider a class declared as follows.

[source, java]
---
package a.b;

public class Something {
	…
}
---

Here are some claims about its name and about the name of the file that contains this declaration.
Check every true claim.

. Its short name is `Something`
. Its full name is `Something`
. [true-claim] Its full name is `a.b.Something`
. Its full name is `a/b/Something`
. Its full name is `/a/b/Something`
. Its file name is `Something.source`
. [true-claim] Its file name is `Something.java`
. Its file name is `Something.class`
. The absolute path to the directory that contains its file is `/a/b/`
. The absolute path to the directory that contains its file is `/packages/`
. The absolute path to the directory that contains its file is `/packages/a/b/`
. The absolute path to the directory that contains its file is `/source/`
. The absolute path to the directory that contains its file is `/source/a/b/`
. [true-claim] The absolute path to the directory that contains its file ends with `/a/b/`
. The absolute path to the directory that contains its file ends with `/packages/`
. The absolute path to the directory that contains its file ends with `/packages/a/b/`
. The absolute path to the directory that contains its file ends with `/source/`
. The absolute path to the directory that contains its file ends with `/source/a/b/`

== Q
Consider the class `Something` declared as follows.

[source, java]
---
package a.b;

public class Something {
	public static void doSomething() {
		…
	}
}
---

You are now developing a class `Another`, declared as follows.

[source, java]
---
package a.c;

public class Another {
	public static void proceed() {
		…
	}
}
---

How can you invoke, from the code in `proceed()`, the method `doSomething()` declared in the class `Something`?
Check all the modifications that compile and that indeed permit to call `doSomething()` from `proceed()`.
(Check nothing if none of these suggests permit to invoke `doSomething()` in this context.)

. Just use `a.b.doSomething();`
. [true-claim] Just use `a.b.Something.doSomething();`
. Just use `Something.doSomething();`
. Add `import a.b;` then use `a.b.Something.doSomething();`
. Add `import a.b;` then use `doSomething();`
. Add `import a.b;` then use `Something.doSomething();`
. Add `import Something;` then use `a.b.Something.doSomething();`
. Add `import Something;` then use `doSomething();`
. Add `import Something;` then use `Something.doSomething();`
. [true-claim] Add `import a.b.Something;` then use `a.b.Something.doSomething();`
. Add `import a.b.Something;` then use `doSomething();`
. [true-claim] Add `import a.b.Something;` then use `Something.doSomething();`

== Q
Consider the following program.

[source, java]
---
package a.c;

public class SomeClass {
	private static int a = 0;
	private static int b = 0;
	private static int c = 0;
	
	public static void init(int value) {
		a = 3;
		b = value;
	}
	
	public static void proceed() {
		c = 4;
		System.out.println(a);
		System.out.println(b);
		System.out.println(c);
	}
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		SomeClass.init(42);
		SomeClass.proceed();
	}
}
---

Check every true claims about this program.

. It does not compile
